**EXPORT CONTROL NOTICE:** This repository contains dual-use defensive technologies for Electronic Countermeasures (ECM), cryptography, and autonomous systems coordination. All content is for defensive applications only. See EXPORT-CONTROL.md for compliance requirements.

== Overview

Robodog ECM is a research platform for defensive technologies including:

* **Electronic Countermeasures (ECM)** - Signal jamming, interference detection, and spectrum management
* **Cryptographic Protocols** - Secure communications for autonomous systems
* **Formation Control** - Distributed coordination algorithms for robotic systems
* **Defensive Autonomy** - Collision avoidance, threat detection, and safe operation

**Primary Applications:**
- Defensive military applications (ECM, secure comms)
- Search and rescue coordination
- Disaster response robot swarms
- Secure autonomous system research

**Explicitly NOT for:**
- Offensive weapons systems
- Surveillance or tracking of individuals
- Export to restricted countries
- Any use violating export control regulations

== Relationship to Other Projects

**Separate from:**
- `anvomidav` - Figure skating choreography (civilian, export-safe)
- `robot-vacuum-cleaner` - Domestic robot simulation (civilian)

**Related to:**
- Formation control algorithms (defensive coordination)
- Autonomous navigation (safe operation)
- Cryptographic protocols (secure communications)

== Technology Stack

* **Core Language:** TBD (considering Rust, Ada, or AffineScript)
* **Cryptography:** Modern post-quantum algorithms
* **ECM Simulation:** Software-defined radio (SDR) integration
* **Coordination:** Distributed consensus protocols

== Status

**Phase:** Early Research (v0.1)
**Completion:** ~10%

**Implemented:**
- [ ] ECM signal analysis
- [ ] Cryptographic protocol suite
- [ ] Formation control algorithms
- [ ] Autonomous coordination
- [ ] Export control compliance framework

== Export Control Compliance

This project follows strict export control policies:

1. **No offensive capabilities** - Defensive technologies only
2. **No unauthorized export** - Compliance with ITAR/EAR regulations
3. **Documented use cases** - All implementations have defensive justification
4. **Access control** - Contributors must acknowledge export restrictions

See `EXPORT-CONTROL.md` for full compliance requirements.
